/*
    Create a separate cucumber feature file for each part
    Create a separate step definitions class for each part
    Use TestNG for validation of your tests
    You are not suggested to use POM structure since these are two separated parts of a small projects
    Create a separate Runner class for each feature for running and creating pretty html or json reports
    You are more than welcomed optionally to add some more properties and features and test cases or so.
    Good luck!
